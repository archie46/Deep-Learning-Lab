Aim: Basic Concept of Tensor
This experiment introduces the fundamental concepts of tensors, including their creation, manipulation, and basic operations.

Experiment 2
Aim: Basic Programs on Tensor
This experiment involves writing basic programs to understand tensor operations in TensorFlow.

Experiment 3
Aim: Logistic Regression for Binary Classification with Core APIs Implementation of logistic regression for binary classification using TensorFlow's core APIs.

Experiment 4
Aim: The Sequential Model
Introduction to the Sequential model in TensorFlow, demonstrating how to build and compile a model using this API.
